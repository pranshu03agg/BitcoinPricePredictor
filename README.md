# Bitcoin Price Predictor Using Sentiments and LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices by incorporating sentiment analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It leverages historical Bitcoin price data and sentiment scores from news and social media to improve prediction accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment from news and social media data.
- **LSTM Model**: Implements LSTM networks to predict Bitcoin prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares both price and sentiment data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of data trends and model predictions.
- **Customizable Forecasting**: Allows for adjusting model parameters and forecasting windows.

## Data Analyzed
- **Bitcoin Historical Prices**: Data on past Bitcoin prices.
- **Sentiment Scores**: Sentiment analysis data derived from news articles and social media posts.
- **Combined Dataset**: Merges price and sentiment data for model training and prediction.
